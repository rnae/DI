Problem:
Mary has to build a simple list of featured products, pulled from a database table and displayed on a web page; an example is shown in figure 2.3. If the user viewing the list is a preferred customer, the price on all products should be discounted by five percent.


Solution
1. create a project with 3 layers: DAL, BSS/DLL, UI
- DAL uses EF and it contains the context for Product entity
- BSS refers DAL and exposes a ProductService that returns Product entity from DAL
- UI referes BSS and returns the result.

Obs:
- EF must be refered in both DAL and BSS
- DAL must be refered in BSS and UI also
- What happens if we need change
